# Synoptic Case Study Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that cover many different analysis types for synoptic meteorology events. The NARR notebooks utilizes widgets which run best in the jupyter notebook environment and will run in jupyter lab, but only if the extensions are properly enabled. The GFS based notebooks use some form of GFS output (analysis or forecasts). Notebooks can be easily modified to use other model output without too much difficulty.
